 * Testing Concurrent Programs chapter.
 * Related to liveness tests are performance tests. Performance can be measured in a number of ways, including:
 * Throughput: the rate at which a set of concurrent tasks is completed;
 * Responsiveness: the delay between a request for and completion of some action (also called latency); or
 * Scalability: the improvement in throughput (or lack thereof) as more resources (usually CPUs) are made available.
