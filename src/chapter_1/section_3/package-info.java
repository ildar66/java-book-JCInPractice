 * Risks of Threads
 * 
 * Java's built-in support for threads is a double-edged sword. While it simplifies the development of concurrent applications by providing language
 * and library support and a formal cross-platform memory model (it is this formal cross-platform memory model thatmakes possible the development of
 * write-once, run-anywhere concurrent applications in Java), it also raises the bar for developers because more programs will use threads. When
 * threads were more esoteric, concurrency was an "advanced" topic; now, mainstream developers must be aware of thread-safety issues.
