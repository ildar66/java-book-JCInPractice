 * Benefits of Threads section.
 * 
 * When used properly, threads can reduce development and maintenance costs and improve the performance of complex applications. Threads make it
 * easier to model how humans work and interact, by turning asynchronous workflows into mostly sequential ones. They can also turn otherwise
 * convoluted code into straight-line code that is easier to write, read, and maintain.
 * Threads are useful in GUI applications for improving the responsiveness of the user interface, and in server applications for improving resource
 * utilization and throughput. They also simplify the implementation of the JVMthe garbage collector usually runs in one or more dedicated threads.
 * Most nontrivial Java applications rely to some degree on threads for their organization.
