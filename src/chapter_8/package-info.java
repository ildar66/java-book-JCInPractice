 * The Executor framework is a powerful and flexible framework for concurrently executing tasks. It offers a number of tuning options, such as
 * policies for creating and tearing down threads, handling queued tasks, and what to do with excess tasks, and provides several hooks for extending
 * its behavior. As in most powerful frameworks, however, there are combinations of settings that do not work well together; some types of tasks
 * require specific execution policies, and some combinations of tuning parameters may produce strange results.
