 * Designing a Thread-safe Class
 *
 * The design process for a thread-safe class should include these three basic elements:

     Identify the variables that form the object's state;

     Identify the invariants that constrain the state variables;

     Establish a policy for managing concurrent access to the object's state.

/*
    You cannot ensure thread safety without understanding an object's invariants and postconditions.
    Constraints on the valid values or state transitions for state variables can create atomicity and encapsulation requirements.
