 * Task Execution chapter
 *
 * Most concurrent applications are organized around the execution of tasks: abstract, discrete units of work.
 * Dividing the work of an application into tasks simplifies program organization,
 * facilitates error recovery by providing natural transaction boundaries,
 * and promotes concurrency by providing a natural structure for parallelizing work.
