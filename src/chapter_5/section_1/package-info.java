 * Synchronized Collections section.
 *
 * The synchronized collection classes include Vector and Hashtable, part of the original JDK, as well as their cousins added in JDK 1.2, the
 * synchronized wrapper classes created by the Collections.synchronizedXxx factory methods. These classes achieve thread safety by encapsulating their
 * state and synchronizing every public method so that only one thread at a time can access the collection state.
