 * Building Blocks
 *
 * The last chapter explored several techniques for constructing thread-safe classes, including delegating thread safety to existing thread-safe
 * classes. Where practical, delegation is one of the most effective strategies for creating thread-safe classes: just let existing thread-safe
 * classes manage all the state.
 * 
 * The platform libraries include a rich set of concurrent building blocks, such as thread-safe collections and a variety of synchronizers that can
 * coordinate the control flow of cooperating threads. This chapter covers the most useful concurrent building blocks, especially those introduced in
 * Java 5.0 and Java 6, and some patterns for using them to structure concurrent applications.
