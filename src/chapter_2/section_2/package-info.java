 * Atomicity section.
 *
 * Operations A and B are atomic with respect to each other if, from the perspective of a thread executing A, when another thread executes B, either
 * all of B has executed or none of it has. An atomic operation is one that is atomic with respect to all operations, including itself, that operate
 * on the same state.
