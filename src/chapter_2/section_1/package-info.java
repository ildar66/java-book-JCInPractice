 * What is Thread Safety?  section.
 *
 * A class is thread-safe if it behaves correctly when accessed from multiple threads, regardless of the scheduling or interleaving of the execution
 * of those threads by the runtime environment, and with no additional synchronization or other coordination on the part of the calling code.
 *
 * Thread-safe classes encapsulate any needed synchronization so that clients need not provide their own.
